# We will pass a parameter in the method (data)
We start with assinging a empty hash so that the new data goes in the hash. lets say hash ={}
Now we will iterate over the data with each method and give a key and value. 
This will give us the key and value which is rest of the data.
Now will take the value and iterate again to get the first key and array data. 
We will now iterate over the value to pull elements and provide and pass a variable in the block. 

We will then use our empty hash{} with the value and assign it create key for "color" , "gender" and "lives "
